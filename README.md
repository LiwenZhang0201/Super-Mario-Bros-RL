# Deep Reinforcement Learning : A3C | PPO | Intrinsic Curiosity Module applied to Super Mario Bros.


This is the final project for the Reinforcement Learning course at the MVA Masters 2018/2019. 

The project was done by [Amine Sadeq](https://github.com/sadeqa) & [Otmane Sakhi](https://github.com/otmhi), You can check the final project paper : ["Exploring Deep Reinforcement Learning with Super Mario Bros"] in this repository.

It explores A3C and PPO algorithms and combine them with an intrinsic reward based on curiosity.
